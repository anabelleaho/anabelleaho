- 👋 Hi, Anabelle here!
  
- 🖥️ I'm a newly graduated web developer
  
- 📚 Am currently looking to learn Python and focus on Javascript with Node.js to increase my skills in web development!
  
- 💾 I participated in a collaborative project called [LeadsPro](https://leadspro-9ddc3d1f2886.herokuapp.com/),
  wherein our team developed a mobile-responsive website that prioritized effective lead management.
  Our solution leveraged AI-powered sentiment analysis to intelligently pre-screen leads based on their quality,
  thereby optimizing conversion rates.

- 🐹 I do volunteer work with a small animal rescue in my free time
  
- 🐶 ... and also enjoy outdoor activities with my dog too!
  
- 📱 You can find me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anabelle-ho/) profile here
